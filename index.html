      <p class="middleC row">
        Hello! My name is Jeremy Schneider. I was raised in the Ohio River Valley Region and will be graduating
        this fall at Indiana University. As of now, I live in Bloomington and help my dad with his
        HVAC shop and actively hike with my fiance when I am not researching or working on old
        hardware.
      </p>
      <p class="middleC row">
        As for school, I enjoy studying culture, performance, religion and literature which is why
        I have chosen to major in English Literature. Although I am majoring in
        the humanities I have a fascination for the hisotry of computing
        and computer science. So despite simply being an English B.A.
        I have found that my experience rebuilding vintage and modern hardware
        along with manipulating their operating systems serves to grow upon my
        own understanding of literature's interconnectivity with other subjects, as it
        can be found in conversation with science, philosophy, mathematics, and history.
      </p>
      <p class="row middleC">
        This recognition and engagement of the texts then leaves me with a certain attentiveness and mindfulness towards the world.
        As in my world is not so distant or separate from those that we read about but evidently shared.
        For once this connection is realized and the alienation is removed,
        I truly believe an empathetic perspective can flourish and I
        will try to understand and embrace others in my own and outside
        communities. With that said, I am aware this connection I draw between the humanities and computation is
        strange but I often find myself reassured by its relevancy. So much so that combining these two spaces
        is what <strong>motivates</strong> me everyday.

          <p class="middleC row">
            Since being introduced to Latin and Greek mythology in high school--and
            Roman and Greek philosophers in debate and philosophy club, I have always been drawn to
            the <i>classics</i>. I have always found through my own reading of these texts a sense of
            connection that is entirely present, as in I would argue that I am
            not seeking for a nostaligic enviroment to dwell in by studing these texts.
            I love these texts and the worlds they invoke because they help me understand
            my own world. More so, in the act of 'going back' by engaging with these texts I find
            that I can always find their influential roots traced in modern works.
            However, I have often felt that these texts can be discussed with the focus on
            hero and plot in such a way that feels practicly scientific and methodical.

          <h5 class="sTitle">HCI/d Concept for Digital Thrifting (fall 2020)</h5>
          <p class="middleC row">
            <strong>Observations within Fashion</strong>
            <br>
            When asked to research fashion in regard to technological design, I
            immediately thought of the ways in which fashion has played role in
            my life when I make purchasing decisions. This is when thrift-shopping or
            second-hand clothing purchases either retail or online immediately entered
            my focus. I begin to recall the initial reasons I primarily purchase clothing
            second-hand and begin to delve into a research rabbit hole to find out why others
            choose so as well. While embarking on this journey, I discovered that thrift
            shopping for clothing has been a growing trend in the (US and other nations)
            for the last decade, but specifically rising in digital spaces (i.e. Facebook
            Marketplace, eBay, Poshmark, Depop, Etsy and Grailed) which is suggested
            to be caused by the rise in ‘fast-fashion’ and financial decision making post
            the 2008 recession.
          </p>
          <p class="middleC row">
            <strong>Why care about thrift-sellers in digital spaces?</strong>
            <br>
            Well with the rise of fast fashion, general spending
            habits of the U.S. population, and access of those on these platforms,
            I found it necessary to examine and try to solve the barriers which prevents
            participation. Why I care? Because participation in this growing digital
            market, leads to pro-social behaviors (as in these
            digital markets rely on the connections individuals make with those who
            sell used goods in their physical communities)--thus leading to a form environmental
            responsibility by entering a ‘sustainable’ practice, and a way for individuals
            to gain financial rewarded while personally growing through learning about
            the culture as a whole (for example why might someone want to purchase  an item),
            and finally this space has been show in several studies to offer mental
            health (self-care) benefits.

                I completed this concept for INFO -I300 (Human Computer Interaction and Design)
                and like the Tragedy Project it showcases my research and presentation skills. More so, as
                a requirement for this project I had to spend two weeks
                researching the topic space learn Adobe Indesign along with the topics user space .
